    "text": "Sam Weiner is an aspiring Data Scientist who is excited to bring creativity and analytical know-how to your data science team.\nI became interested in data science because of my growing curiosity. In my undergraduate philosophy courses, I enjoyed learning about and debating the answers to fascinating philosophical questions, but as my interests broadened from theoretical questions to practical ones, I realized that the skills I had as a philosopher were insufficient to answering real-word questions. When I heard about data science for the first time, I knew that becoming a data scientist was going to be my path forward to gaining a better understanding of our world. My curiosity has only grown as I have embarked on this journey, and I am so excited to dive into all of the data I can get my hands on to deepen my knowledge of the relationships and events that make up our endlessly fascinating world!\nMy journey has led me to become proficient in R, Python, and SQL. I have become intimately familiar with statistical learning techniques in the inferential world - linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, causal inference - as well as in the predictive world - random forests, XGBoost, neural networks. I am leveraging Tableau and ggplot2 to create intuitive data visualizations to communicate data analysis to a broad audience.\nI am still passionate about big philosophical questions, and I love to have stimulating conversations with my friends or strangers! In my free time, you might see me watching college wresting (Go RU!) or obsessing over perfect hummus recipe."
